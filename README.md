  <h1>Data Scientist Salary Analysis</h1>

  <p>This project focuses on exploring and analyzing data related to Data Scientist salaries. The dataset used in this project contains information about various factors that can influence salary levels, such as work year, experience level, employment type, job title, and more. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the factors that impact data scientist salaries and uncover any patterns or trends in the data.</p>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>The dataset used for this analysis consists of the following columns:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>work_year</strong>: Represents the specific year in which the salary was disbursed.</li>
    <li><strong>experience_level</strong>: Indicates the level of experience a person holds in a particular job.</li>
    <li><strong>employment_type</strong>: Represents the nature of the employment contract, such as full-time, part-time, or contractual.</li>
    <li><strong>job_title</strong>: Reflects the role an individual holds within a company.</li>
    <li><strong>salary</strong>: Represents the total gross salary paid to the individual.</li>
    <li><strong>salary_currency</strong>: Indicates the specific currency in which the salary is paid.</li>
    <li><strong>salary_in_usd</strong>: Represents the total gross salary amount converted to US dollars.</li>
    <li><strong>employee_residence</strong>: Indicates the primary country of residence of the employee.</li>
    <li><strong>remote_ratio</strong>: Represents the proportion of work done remotely.</li>
    <li><strong>company_location</strong>: Indicates the location of the employer's main office or branch.</li>
    <li><strong>company_size</strong>: Represents the median number of employees in the company during the work year.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Analysis Steps</h2>

  <p>The following steps were performed in this data analysis project:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Data Cleaning: The dataset was inspected for missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Necessary data cleaning techniques were applied to ensure the data's quality and integrity.</li>
    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various exploratory analyses were conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This involved examining the distributions, relationships, and summary statistics of the variables.</li>
    <li>Data Visualization: Visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts, were created to effectively communicate the findings and patterns discovered during the analysis.</li>
    
  </ol>
